Add form fields like text, paragraph, file upload, checkbox etc on divi visual builder via corresponding divi modules. 

A custom divi module for each form field.

Such a setup makes it possible to use divi's native user interface grid. Since the grid is responsive, forms are responsive.

Create a divi form section having rows with different columns. Place the form field divi module in the columns. 

Get responsive form build without breaking a sweat.


## Form Fields Divi Modules

Plugin supports following field types. Note: This list will grow as we add new field types

-   **Single Line Text** - A single line text field.
-   **Paragraph Text** - A multi line text field
-   **Checkbox** - A multi-select tickbox field
-   **Radio** -A radio field to select a single option
-   **File Upload** - A field to enable file uploads
-   **Drop Down** - Dropdown field to select an option from multi-choices.
-   **Email** - A text field with email validation
-   **Consent** - A field with a tick switch toggle and description
-   **Submit Button** - A field to create form's submit button

Each form field has a corresponding divi module. 

A form field module contains

* Field settings like label, name etc.
* Validation settings like required, min/max etc
* Settings specific to that field like max file upload size, allow extensions etc.

Browser-side validation, before submitting the form, is an integral part of the validation process.

Form style design settings are available on the parent divi section's setting options.

No one likes canned email notifications. It ought to be personal.

To personalize, create custom email notifications with dynamic content while setting the form. 

Use dynamic data from the form submission in your form notifications. 

Dynamic Content can be user's name, email etc found in a form submission


## Store Form Submissions In Database

Worried that you might miss a form submission notification. Email delivery isn't 100% guaranteed.
